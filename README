This repository contains some scripts I wrote to make life easier for me.


html2js: Simple C++ script to convert HTML to Javascript. I used it to make my own primitive HTML templating system.
Usage: g++ html2js -o html2js
  ./html2js in.html out.js
  
getIEEEabstract.py: Gets the abstracts of all the IEEE pdfs in the current directory and then writes it to summary.html

renameIEEE.py: Renames all the IEEE pdfs in the current directory to their paper titles.
